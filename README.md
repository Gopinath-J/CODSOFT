Random Number Generation: A random number between 1 and 100 is generated at the start of each round.

User Guessing: The user is prompted to guess the number within a limited number of attempts (10 in this case).

Feedback: After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.

Rounds: The game consists of multiple rounds (5 in this case).

Score Calculation: The user's score is calculated based on the number of remaining attempts after correctly guessing the number.

Game Over: After the final round, the user's total score is displayed.
